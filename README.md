## Acquiring book data
_(on Android with root access; you can use an emulator)_

1. Download the book(s) from the Scribd application and skip through a few chapters for each one (just so you're sure it has been successfully downloaded; isn't necessary, but recommended)
2. Exit the Scribd application
3. Go to `/data/data/com.scribd.app.reader0/shared_prefs/` and copy `FILENAME_KEYS.xml` to your PC
4. Go to `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.scribd.app.reader0/files/` and copy the entire `document_cache` folder to your PC

## Usage
5. Start SCRIMTEC
6. Click on the big "..." button beneath "`FILENAME_KEYS.xml` path" and locate your `FILENAME_KEYS.xml` file
7. Click on the little "..." button above "Convert" and locate your `document_cache` folder
8. Click convert
9. ???
10. Profit!

## Troubleshooting
If conversion fails, then double check if the files are intact. Files get corrupted oftenly during Android -> PC transfer.
